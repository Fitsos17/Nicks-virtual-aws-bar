# What did I learn from this project

Under construction... 🚧

# The goals

- The customers can enter Nicks' bar and sit at a table, at a sunbed or at a bar stool. They can then check the catalog and order a drink.
- After they order the drink, they will pay its price.
- After they enjoyed the drink and they are ready to leave,they will mark the table/sunbed as free so other customers could sit and enjoy a drink.

The information and the description of the drinks will be generated by ai.

# What services did I use?

I will use AWS services and the AWS Javascript CDK

1. API Gateway for creating the REST API
2. Lambda functions as a backbone of the REST API
3. DynamoDB that will be used for storing the catalogs, orders and seats
4. SQS queue for creating orders
5. Eventbridge for the ordering system (?)
6. Amazon bedrock or another ai api for generating the catalog

# Prompts that I used

I use the aws nova micro ai model from bedrock. Prompts:

- For generating tables, bar seats and sunbeds (seats.js and database):

  `Generate a JSON array of seating objects for a bar. Each object has: id, number_of_seats (1 to max per type), type (bar stool, table, sunbed), tableType (only if type is table), comments (describe the seat) and taken (false). I want: 5 <= number of bar stools <= 10; 4 <= number of sunbeds <= 7; 10 tables Generate plain text, no JSON wrapper and additional textes`

- For generating drinks (catalog.js and database):

  `Generate a plain text JSON array of 10 drink objects with the structure: {id, name, ingredients, description, type, price}. Each drink must have a unique id, an emoji after the name, ingredients as a single string, an enticing description, and a type (whiskey, cocktail, burbon), with one being "special". Include prices. Use a plain text, no json wrapper and additional text`
