# Nicks' beach Bar 🍻 (Self service ordering api)

This api lets the customers of a bar sit to an empty table and enjoy a refreshing drink 🍹

## The goals 💻

- The customers can enter Nicks' bar and sit at a table or at a sunbed and enjoy the beach view. They can then check the catalog and order a drink. They should get recommendations and additional information about the drinks.
- When they order the drink, they would also pay for it (pay the price and even leave a tip if they want).
- When the order is complete, the barmen would be notified in a screen and then they should start making the drink.
- After the drink is ready, the waiters would be notified and then pass the drinks to the customers.
- When the customers are ready to leave, they should leave a review if they want and then they will mark the table/sunbed as free so other customers could sit and enjoy a drink.

### Other suggestions 💭

The information and the description of the drinks could be generated by ai and the recommendation system (drink of the day and why) should be implemented by ai too.
-> The Admin should upload the catalog in a dynamodb table and then in an etl pipeline (step functions):

- Data would be extracted from dynamodb (with a lambda function)
- The ai agent will generate information about the drink and will create a very small summary we can pass to the catalog
- The data would be loaded back to dynamodb

# What services I will use? 🚌

I will use AWS services and the AWS Javascript CDK

1. API Gateway for creating a REST API
2. Lambda functions that are the backbone of API Gateway
3. DynamoDB that will be used for storing the catalogs
4. SQS queue for creating orders and give them to the barmen
5. Eventbridge for payments (if implemented)
6. Additional AI stuff (such as bedrock and lex for a small chatbot that could be used as a waiter)
